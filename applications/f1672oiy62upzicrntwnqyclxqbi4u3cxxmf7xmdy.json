    "Brief history of your project and organization": "NOAA's operational STOFS-3D-Atlantic output is available here: s3://noaa-nos-stofs3d-pds/STOFS-3D-Atl/\n\nNOAA's collaborator, Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS), runs a shadow model for STOFS-3D-Atlantic. Its output is available here: s3://noaa-nos-stofs3d-pds/STOFS-3D-Atl-shadow-VIMS/",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "Yes",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The 3-D component of the STOFS, namely, STOFS-3D-Atlantic provides users with the 24-hour nowcasts (analyses of near present conditions) and up to 96-hour forecast guidance of the water level conditions, as well as 2- and 3-dimensional fields of water temperature, salinity, and currents. STOFS-3D-Atlantic is run one time (on 12 UTC) per day. The system domain encompasses the U.S. East Coast, Gulf Coast, and Puerto Rico, and Gulf of St. Lawrence. The water levels produced by the STOFS-3D-Atlantic represent the combined tidal and subtidal water surface elevations and are unanimously referenced to xGEOID20B. STOFS-3D-Atlantic is providing a new variable called “water level disturbance”, which is defined as water level height above xGEOID20B for topobathy below xGEOID20B (e.g. ocean), and as water level height above ground for topobathy above xGEOID20B (e.g. land). Maximum height in the STOFS-3D-Atlantic grid is 10 m above xGEOID20B.\n\nSTOFS-3D-Atlantic employs the Semi-implicit Cross-scale Hydroscience Integrated System Model (SCHISM) as the hydrodynamic model core. Its unstructured model grid consists of 2,926,236 nodes and 5,654,157 triangular or quadrilateral elements. The total number of 3D grid points is 31,307,038. Grid resolution is 1.5-2 km near the shoreline, ~600 m for the floodplain, down to 8 m for watershed rivers (at least 3 nodes across each river cross-section), and around 2-10 m for levees. Along the U.S. coastline, the land boundary of the domain aligns with the 10-m contour above xGEOID20B, encompassing the coastal transitional zone most vulnerable to coastal and inland flooding. The number of vertical layers ranges from 49 in the deepest part of the Atlantic Ocean to just 1 layer in floodplain areas. The model run uses a computational time step of 150 s. In total, STOFS-3D-Atlantic currently simulates 1 day of simulation in 0.40 wall clock hours on 4320 computational cores.\nThe files provided here include GRIB2 format for regional grids and SHEF format for station time series; both GRIB2 and SHEF are coincidentally provided to National Weather Service forecasters through AWIPS. The files are also provided here in native netCDF format, which include the full native resolution model grids and station time series; and the geopackage (gpkg) files for the field time series of water level disturbance over the entire domain.\ns3://noaa-nos-stofs3d-pds\t797.1 TiB",
