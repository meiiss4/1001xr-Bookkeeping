    "Brief history of your project and organization": "NLR is the U.S. Department of Energy's primary national laboratory for energy systems.\nWith a focus on security and reliability, NLR leads energy systems innovation and integration—enhancing existing technologies and developing new, cutting-edge solutions that unlock economic opportunity and fuel America's global competitiveness.\nNLR bridges foundational research with practical applications to integrate various energy sources, storage, buildings, transportation, and emerging technologies.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "Data released from projects funded by the Department of Energy's Geothermal Technologies Office (DOE GTO) that are too large or complex to be conveniently accessed by traditional means. The GDR data lake aims to improve and automate access of high-value geothermal data sets, making data actionable and discoverable by researchers and industry to accelerate analysis and advance innovation. This data lake is a sister-data lake to the Department of Energy’s Open Energy Data Initiative (OEDI) Data Lake.\nhttps://registry.opendata.aws/gdr-data-lake/   230.0 TiB",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "1. Download the data from AWS:aws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://gdr-data-lake/egs_collab/experiment_1/EGS_CASSM/\n2. Use the secondary development software of go-car to generate a CAR file (size 22-27 GB).\n3. Distribute the CAR file to SP nodes via hard disk.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://data.openei.org/s3_viewer?bucket=gdr-data-lake&prefix=egs_collab%2Fexperiment_1%2FEGS_CASSM%2F  \naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://gdr-data-lake/imperialvalleydas/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1 to 1.5 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Asia other than Greater China, North America",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "Shipping hard drives",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f02827565  Vietnam  \nf02826715  United States  \nf02825420  Taiwan  \nf02827377  Taiwan  \nf02827448  Vietnam\nf03663680  Hong Kong  \nf03663684  Hong Kong",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
